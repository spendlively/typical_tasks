IMPORTANT NOTE:

This course makes use of the PHP Password Hashing API (https://php.net/manual/en/book.password.php), which requires a minimum of PHP 5.5. If your server is running PHP 5.4, obtain the password_compat library from https://github.com/ircmaxell/password_compat, and include it in the locations indicated in Chapter 5.

The code will not work with PHP 5.3 or earlier.
